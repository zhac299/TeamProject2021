- Kitchen menu should not have access to isPaid, isConfirmed and isDelivered fields
- Kitchen staff shouuld not have the notifications pannel
- Order total (in the waiter, kithcen and manager side) initially displaying as NaaN, only displays as total after closing and opening the order
- Order total (in the waiter, kithcen and manager side) not updating correctly
- Changing to a new category delted the number of selected meals in the former category in the customer menu (even though not deleting them from the basket).
- Need to add refresh needed for the order tracking and basket in the customer menu

## Bugs and Design Flaws

Customer Menu: 

1.Add a reset button for all the allergies and Calories that switches the menj to default.
2.Filtering not done automatically, but through a button. Should be refactored 

Waiter Menu:

1.There are 2 scroll bars in the Add Menu Item pop up form
2.There are 2 scroll bars in the Edit Menu Item pop up form
3.The selected dish types and calories even though they are saved on the DB, are not displayed on the menu items list (in the edit menu item component).
